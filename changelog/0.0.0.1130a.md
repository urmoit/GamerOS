### Graphics System Refactor

This release includes a significant refactor of the graphics system to move away from legacy VGA mode 13h and towards a more modern framebuffer-based approach. This change is crucial for supporting higher resolutions and color depths.

**Key Changes:**

*   **Framebuffer Integration:**
    *   Introduced `src/intf/framebuffer.h` and `src/impl/x86_64/framebuffer.c` to define and manage framebuffer information.
    *   Modified `src/impl/x86_64/boot/main.asm` to parse Multiboot2 framebuffer tags provided by GRUB, storing essential display parameters (address, width, height, pitch, bits-per-pixel).
    *   Updated `targets/x86_64/iso/boot/grub/grub.cfg` to explicitly request a 1024x768x32 framebuffer from GRUB using `multiboot2_framebuffer`.

*   **Generic Graphics API:**
    *   Replaced `src/intf/vga_graphics.h` and `src/impl/x86_64/vga_graphics.c` with `src/intf/graphics.h` and `src/impl/x86_64/graphics.c`.
    *   The new `graphics.c` implements drawing primitives (e.g., `put_pixel`, `draw_rectangle`) that operate directly on the framebuffer, removing reliance on BIOS interrupts.

*   **Desktop and Mouse Driver Updates:**
    *   `src/impl/x86_64/desktop.c` and `src/impl/x86_64/mouse.c` were updated to utilize the new generic graphics API, ensuring compatibility with the framebuffer.

*   **Kernel Main Function (`src/impl/kernel/main.c`):**
    *   Reverted the temporary text-only output and re-enabled the desktop initialization.
    *   Added debugging output to display the parsed framebuffer information (address, width, height, pitch, BPP) to aid in troubleshooting.

*   **Build System (`Makefile`):**
    *   Updated to correctly compile the new `framebuffer.c` and `graphics.c` files, and to remove references to the old `vga_graphics.c`.

**Purpose of Changes:**

These changes aim to resolve the "black screen" issue by correctly initializing and utilizing the framebuffer for graphical output, paving the way for a functional Windows 11-like desktop environment. The debugging output for framebuffer information will help diagnose why the display is still black.
