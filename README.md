## About The Project

GamerOS is a 64-bit hobby operating system with a custom kernel, graphical desktop, and windowing system inspired by Windows 11. It runs on the x86_64 architecture and is written from scratch in C and x86-64 Assembly. The project aims to provide a modern desktop experience with direct hardware access, featuring a custom-built graphical user interface.

**Planned Features:**
*   Support for running Linux applications.
*   Compatibility layer for Windows applications.
*   Ability to run APK files (Android apps).

The latest ISO file can always be found in the `dist/x86_64` folder.

## Features

*   **Custom 64-bit Kernel:** x86_64, ELF format, with no standard library dependencies.
*   **Graphical Desktop Environment:** Inspired by Windows 11, featuring:
    *   Taskbar, Start Menu, and System Tray
    *   Multiple movable windows (e.g., File Explorer, Settings)
    *   Desktop icons like "This PC" and "Recycle Bin"
*   **Graphics:** VGA (320x200x256) graphics mode 13h.
*   **Input:** Mouse cursor with simulated/keyboard movement and keyboard event handling.
*   **System:** Real-Time Clock (RTC) reading and display, and hardware interrupt controllers (PIC, IDT) setup.
*   **Build Environment:** Portable Makefile and Docker-based build environment for easy setup.
*   **Emulation:** QEMU virtualization for easy testing and development.

## Roadmap

*   [ ] Implement a proper memory manager.
*   [ ] Develop a file system.
*   [ ] Add more UI features and improve the desktop experience.
