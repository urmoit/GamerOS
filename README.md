# GamerOS: A Simple x86_64 Operating System with Windows 11-Like Desktop

GamerOS is a 64-bit hobby operating system with a custom kernel, graphical desktop, and windowing system inspired by Windows 11. It runs on x86_64, supports basic keyboard and mouse (emulated/simulated), and demonstrates UI elements such as windows, taskbar, start menu, and more—all written from scratch in C and x86-64 assembly with direct hardware access using VGA graphics.

## Features
- Custom 64-bit kernel (x86_64, ELF format, no standard library)
- Graphical desktop environment, inspired by Windows 11
  - Taskbar, Start menu, system tray
  - Multiple movable windows (File Explorer, Settings, etc.)
  - Simple desktop icons ("This PC", "Recycle Bin", etc.)
- VGA (320x200x256) graphics mode 13h
- Mouse cursor with simulated/keyboard move
- Keyboard event handling and interrupt setup
- Real-Time Clock reading and display
- Hardware interrupt controllers (PIC, IDT) setup
- Portable Makefile and Docker-based build environment
- QEMU virtualization for easy emulation

## Directory Structure
- `src/impl/kernel/`         — Kernel main entry point and logic
- `src/impl/x86_64/`         — x86_64 arch-specific C and ASM (desktop, drivers, graphics)
- `src/intf/`                — C header files (API declarations for drivers, UI, etc.)
- `build/`                   — Compiled object files (autogenerated)
- `dist/`                    — Kernel binaries and bootable ISO output
- `targets/`                 — BIOS/bootloader configuration, linker script, GRUB config
- `buildenv/`                — Dockerfile and scripts for portable cross-compiler and build env

## Project Requirements
- 64-bit Linux PC, Mac, or Windows with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed
- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) for virtualization/emulation
- (On host or via Docker) Required build tools:
  - `build-essential`, `nasm`, `xorriso`, `grub-pc-bin`, `qemu-system-x86`
  - Cross-compiler: GCC for x86_64-elf (provided and bootstrapped in Docker build)
  - See Dockerfile for exact software stack

## Building and Running GamerOS

**All build steps below are performed inside the Docker container for portability:**

### 1. Build the Docker Image
```
docker build buildenv -t myos-buildenv
```

### 2. Enter Build Environment
- **Linux/Mac:**
  ```
  docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/root/env myos-buildenv
  ```
- **Windows (CMD):**
  ```
  docker run --rm -it -v "%cd%":/root/env myos-buildenv
  ```
- **Windows (PowerShell):**
  ```
  docker run --rm -it -v "${pwd}:/root/env" myos-buildenv
  ```

### 3. Build the Kernel and ISO
```
make build-x86_64
```
- Output: `dist/x86_64/kernel.bin` (raw kernel), `dist/x86_64/kernel.iso` (bootable ISO)

### 4. Run/Emulate with QEMU
```
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom dist/x86_64/kernel.iso
```
- Closes QEMU before rebuilding for best results

#### Troubleshooting QEMU Paths
- Windows or Linux may require specifying BIOS location with `-L` (see QEMU/BIOS troubleshooting online)

### 5. Cleanup Build Environment
- To exit Docker: `exit`
- To remove Docker image when finished:
```
docker rmi myos-buildenv -f
```

## Code Overview and Extending
- Main kernel starts at `src/impl/kernel/main.c` and launches the Windows 11-like desktop
- Core UI/window/desktop logic is in `src/impl/x86_64/desktop.c` and `vga_graphics.c`
- Devices: Keyboard/mouse/RTC/interrupts are modular, in their named files
- All code is freestanding (no libc)
- See header files in `src/intf/` for interfaces/API
